## Post Content

I am learning how to use the fast expression language; I am not new to coding, and I have experience in Python. Usually, I learn how a language works by testing the functions to ensure they produce the intended output. Is there any way to test an algorithm that I am writing by giving it a small amount of data and seeing the output? In the learning videos, there were some example Excel sheets with eight stocks that showed the output of each calculation stage, these were very useful and I would like to be able to break my code down in a similar way. Is there some way to print values out from my code, debug, etc.?

Brain does not give public data points so you will not be able to break down your code as per the method you suggested.

You can read the article 6 ways to evaluate a new data set, let's implement them into automated code using the ace library:

You can use ACE lib to pull datasets, then study coverage, frequency, distribution and some other metrics to better understand how the data works.

To test and debug algorithms in Fast Expression Language (FEL), start with a small dataset, like the Excel examples in the videos, and use it as input to validate outputs step-by-step. Many platforms offer sandbox environments or debugging tools to inspect intermediate calculations. Break down complex expressions into smaller, testable components, assigning intermediate results to variables for clarity. If your platform supports it, print or log intermediate values to ensure correctness. Alternatively, replicate FEL logic in Python using Pandas to cross-check outputs. This iterative approach helps validate each stage of your code and ensures your algorithms perform as expected.

**Great question!**

While fast expression language doesn't allow for direct "print" debugging like Python, here are some tips:

1. **Use Backtest Insights:** Run small backtests on limited data (e.g., specific regions or date ranges) to observe intermediate results.
2. **Break Down Expressions:** Write simpler, smaller expressions to test specific parts of your algorithm. Combine them step-by-step once verified.
3. **Use Learn Resources:** The Excel sheet examples you mentioned are great for understanding operator outputs. You can recreate similar setups with dummy data to visualize the logic.
4. **Documentation Examples:** Explore the operator-specific documentation for example use cases and expected outputs.

Testing smaller parts systematically will help you debug effectively. Good luck with your learning journey! 😊

Testing FEL code is key! Try splitting expressions into smaller parts, running on sample datasets, or using debugging tools. Python or Excel can also help verify outputs.

It's great that you're diving into the **Fast Expression Language** and leveraging your experience in Python! Given your coding background, it seems like you would like a way to **test and debug** your algorithms, much like how you'd do it in Python, by seeing intermediate outputs and checking if the calculations behave as expected.

To debug FEL algorithms, use small datasets, like Excel examples, for step-by-step validation. Leverage sandbox environments or debugging tools, test complex expressions in parts, log intermediate values, or replicate logic in Python with Pandas for cross-checking.

The fast expression language has only two elements: Data fields and Operators. Check out  [their list](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators)  on the learn section.

It sounds like you're looking for ways to **test and debug** your algorithm in a **step-by-step manner**, especially in the context of using a language like **Fast Expression Language** (which may be similar to scripting within Excel or other analytics platforms).

To test algorithms in FEL, you can break complex expressions into smaller steps and validate each with sample data. While direct debugging isn't available, running backtests on limited datasets can help check logic. Replicating FEL calculations in Python with Pandas can also ensure accuracy. Good luck!

Previously, Brain allowed advisors to use Python to write Alpha models. At that time, you could debug and evaluate each small part of the code. Currently, Brain only supports "Fast expression" for advisors. Perhaps Research will have more advanced features and the ability to use Python to express ideas better.

Given the limitations of "Fast expression," I encourage you to explore in two directions.

1. Within the limits of "Fast expression," you can study the ~183 Operators and 100K+ Datafields. I think mastering them to the point of expertise is already very challenging.

2. Build your own small system and evaluate it yourself. 
You can absolutely use the API to retrieve datasets, perform simulations, evaluate effectiveness, and deduce other interesting insights. Basically, with this approach, you have endless creative possibilities.

Learning videos sometimes include spreadsheets to illustrate how Alphas work or how Operators function. This is often an example for explanation; it doesn't necessarily hold true when applied to a large dataset and across the entire system.

Hello, in 2018 I joined websim and it provided python for us to test, but now it only provides fast expression. I often test by calling data from simulated stock platforms. But the accuracy is not high.

I recommend two approaches given the limitations of "Fast expression": first, focus on mastering the operators and data fields, which is already quite challenging; second, build your own system using the API to retrieve datasets, run simulations, and explore new insights, providing endless creative possibilities.

If you find that your current theme and multiplier combination isn't yielding the right results, consider adjusting the alpha design itself. You could either:

- Choose a different theme with a compatible multiplier.
- Modify your alpha calculation or data selection to better align with the theme’s requirements.

A good way to start is a small dataset and use it to validate your outputs step by step. Many platforms have sandbox environments or debugging tools that let you inspect intermediate calculations, which can be super helpful. Try breaking complex expressions into smaller, testable parts and assign intermediate results to variables for better clarity. If your platform allows, logging or printing values can also help catch errors early. Another trick is to replicate FEL logic in Python with Pandas to cross-check outputs.

Fast Expression Languages (FELs) in quantitative finance enable rapid evaluation of mathematical models with low-latency execution. They optimize performance through vectorized computation, domain-specific functions, and memory-efficient processing. FELs integrate seamlessly with trading systems, supporting both real-time and historical data analysis. Examples include Q/KDB+, Zipline, and proprietary hedge fund languages.

Thanks for raising this — I had the same question when I first started with FEL. The main takeaway for me is that while we can’t “print” values like in Python, there are still good ways to debug. Breaking down expressions into smaller parts and running backtests on limited data windows is really useful. Using small datasets (like the Excel examples) helps you see the operator logic more clearly. Another tip I like is replicating the FEL logic in Python with Pandas to cross-check the outputs — it feels natural if you already have coding experience. Even if it’s not as direct as print debugging, it’s a solid way to build confidence in your signals.
