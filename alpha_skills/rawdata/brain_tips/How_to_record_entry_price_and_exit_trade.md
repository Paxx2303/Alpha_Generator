## Post Content

I have read the post in forums about how to set profit/ stop loss and they provide expressions as below:

close_at_event = trade_when(event, close, -1); 
alpha = trade_when(event, signal, abs(close - close_at_event) / close > .1); 
alpha

However, I don't understand how close_at_event can be entry price, and how do they exit the trade in this code

Hi MP97470!

At first I'll explain the first usage of trade_when:

`Trade_When (x=triggerTradeExp, y=AlphaExp, z=**triggerExitExp**)`

If `**triggerExitExp**> 0`, then `Alpha = NaN`;

**Else**if `triggerTradeExp > 0`, then **`Alpha = AlphaExp`**;

Otherwise, `Alpha = previousAlpha`.

So, when you use `trade_when(a,b,**-1**)`, the `triggerExitExp` is always false, which means you are not exiting the position but only adjusting it when condition "a" is satisfied. In close_at_event = trade_when(event, close, -1); you'll getting the close price that was at event.

Now, at the second usage of trade_when operator: alpha = trade_when(event, signal, abs(close - close_at_event) / close > .1); as a `triggerExitExp`you have an expression that sometimes might output true (1) sometimes might output false (0). If it outputs true (1) then it satisfices following condition:

`**triggerExitExp**` = 1

`**triggerExitExp**> 0`, then `Alpha = NaN`;

meaning that you are not outputting positions - your alpha weight will be nan.

To understand this you need to know how trade_when operator work

trade_when

This operator can be used to change Alpha values only under a specified condition and to retain Alpha values in other cases. It also allows for closing Alpha positions (assigning NaN values) under a specified condition.

Trade_When (x=triggerTradeExp, y=AlphaExp, z=triggerExitExp)

If triggerExitExp > 0, Alpha = NaN.

Else if triggerTradeExp > 0, Alpha = AlphaExp;

else, Alpha = previousAlpha

You can read more about trade_when in the learn section

Hi, I would like to ask if these 2 trade_when conditional types work the same:
A: trade when(a && b, alpha,-1)
B: trade when(b,trade when(a,alpha,-1),-1)

The expression `close_at_event = trade_when(event, close, -1)` sets the entry price (`close_at_event`) by capturing the `close` price at the time the `event` occurs. The `trade_when()` function stores this value when the `event` is true, marking the trade entry point.

The exit condition is managed by `alpha = trade_when(event, signal, abs(close - close_at_event) / close > .1)`. Here, the trade remains active until the price change exceeds 10% (`abs(close - close_at_event) / close > 0.1`). When this condition is met, the trade exits, and `alpha` is updated accordingly, signaling the trade's closure.

Hi PL15523! They should work the same.

**Signal Logic**:
This line seems to define a **condition for exiting the trade** based on **profit/stop loss** logic:

- **`abs(close - close_at_event)`** calculates the **absolute price difference** from the entry price.
- Dividing by **`close`** normalizes this difference into a **percentage move**.
- If this percentage exceeds **10% (0.1)**, it triggers the signal (**true**) to **close the trade**.

- **`close_at_event`** captures the **price at entry**, making it the baseline for calculations.
- The **`alpha` signal** is just a **flag** to indicate an exit condition is met—it doesn’t actually **close the trade**.
- To make this code functional, you need to **add trade execution commands** based on the `alpha` value.

In the provided code, the `close_at_event` variable represents the price at which the position will be closed. However, this variable isn't directly assigned as the entry price but instead as the exit price, as defined in the `trade_when` operator.

### Comment by DP11917 1 year ago
`trade_when(event, close, -1)` is essentially setting the **exit condition** for the trade, based on a specific **event**.

- **`event`**: The condition or trigger that tells the algorithm when to exit the position.
- **`close`**: The price at the moment the trade is closed.
- **`-1`**: This tells the system that the **trade is closed**, indicating the event when the position should be closed.

Hey MP97470! Understanding the nuances of trade_when can be tricky at first, but it gets easier with practice. The close_at_event variable captures the price at the moment your specified event happens, essentially acting like your entry price for that trade. When you call trade_when(event, signal, ...) you're setting exit conditions which can lead to closing your position based on your defined strategy. In essence, it helps automate your trading decisions! Just like in the trading world, it's crucial to keep refining your strategy and understanding the underlying mechanics. Good luck trading!

- You can improve the O/S ratio by either increasing your sales (top line) or reducing your operating costs (bottom line).
- A positive O/S ratio reflects a more efficient business. By focusing on both increasing sales and reducing operating costs, you can achieve a positive ratio over time.

### Comment by TN48752 1 year ago
The O/S ratio is essentially a comparison of IS vs OS. If your operating statement is negative, the ratio will naturally reflect that. Try to increase the operating income (or reduce operating losses) so that the ratio can shift to positive. This can come from increasing revenue or managing costs effectively.

By refining the signal based on these principles and using the right datasets, you can create a strong alpha that performs well in the **China region** with **decay D0**.

### Comment by WX16829 1 year ago
give the following sample to explain：

```python
alpha = trade_when(event, signal, abs(close - close_at_event) / close > 0.1);
```

This line defines the trading condition for alpha. It uses the trade_when function to trigger a trade when the event occurs and the absolute percentage change in price (abs(close - close_at_event) / close) exceeds 10%.
In other words, it exits the trade when the price moves more than 10% away from the entry price (close_at_event).

**`close_at_event = trade_when(event, close, -1);`**
This line is capturing the closing price of the asset when a particular event (defined by `event`) happens. The `trade_when` function is used to define the moment when the event occurs, and the `close` represents the price at that time. The `-1` could be specifying the price at the event or the close price of the previous bar (depending on the context of the framework you're using).

Sometimes, platform-specific issues or nuances with theme multipliers might be hard to figure out without specific knowledge of the platform you're using. You might want to consult the platform’s documentation or reach out to their support team for further clarification on the error and possible solutions.

**Reduce Structural Costs (OS)**: Evaluate your structural costs (e.g., administrative expenses, fixed costs). Look for opportunities to reduce overheads, renegotiate contracts, optimize workforce efficiency, and potentially downsize non-essential functions.

### Comment by NN89351 1 year ago
Getting the hang of `trade_when` can feel tricky at first, but it definitely gets easier with practice! The `close_at_event` variable basically locks in the price at the moment your chosen event happens—it’s like your entry price for the trade. When you use `trade_when(event, signal, ...)`, you’re setting up exit conditions based on your strategy, helping automate decision-making. The key is to keep refining your approach and really understanding how these mechanics play out in different market conditions.

Mastering trade_when takes practice. The close_at_event variable captures price at the event, acting as the entry price. It automates exits based on strategy, so refining and understanding mechanics is key.

### Comment by YQ51506 8 months ago
这个代码片段确实有点confusing。close_at_event这里其实是在记录事件发生时的收盘价作为参考点，但严格来说并不是entry price，更像是触发信号时的基准价格。exit逻辑是通过abs(close - close_at_event)/close > 0.1这个条件实现的，当价格波动超过10%时会触发交易信号。在WorldQuant Brain平台上回测时，我会用trade_when配合price_ratio算子来构建类似的止盈止损逻辑，不过需要更清晰地定义entry和exit的条件。大佬这个写法虽然简洁，但实际回测中可能需要考虑slippage和交易成本的影响。
