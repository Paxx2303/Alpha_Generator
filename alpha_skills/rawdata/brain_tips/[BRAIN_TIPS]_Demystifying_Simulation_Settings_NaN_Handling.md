**What is NaN?**

NaN, or 'Not a Number', indicates results of invalid operations (like division by zero) or missing data. For instance, earnings news data might not be available between quarterly announcements. If a stock's input data on a specific date is NaN, the simulation doesn't allocate any weights to the stock.

This is different from an Alpha value of 0, which may become non-zero after backend operations like decay and neutralization, and result in the simulation allocating weight to that stock.

**Why is NaN important?**

- When a stock’s value within an Alpha is NaN, the stock won't get any weight, reducing your coverage, capturing less trading opportunities and potentially lowering your Alpha's Sharpe ratio.
- Fluctuating NaN data can also cause unnecessary or unexpected volatility and higher turnover in your simulations. For example, you may allocate 0.2 weight to a stock on Day 1, then no weights on Day 2 when data is NaN, and 0.2 weight again on Day 3 when data is available again.

**What does NaN Handling do?**

- When NaN Handling is 'Off' (default setting): The NaNs in the input data for all stocks are preserved, and you will need to manually address NaNs in your Alpha expression
- When ***NaN Handling = “On”***, NaN values are handled based on operator type.

- For time series operators, if input data = NaN, then Alpha value = 0.
- For group operators, if input data = NaN, then Alpha value = group value.

For example, for the expression group_max(sales, industry), if sales = NaN for a stock, then Alpha value = maximum value of sales for the stock’s industry. For more examples, check out the Learn article:  [How to choose the Simulation Settings](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/create-alphas/simulation-settings) .

**How can you manually handle NaN?**

Turning on NaN Handling can increase coverage, but may introduce ambiguous data into the Alpha. For stocks with NaN inputs, their Alpha values are simply assumed to be 0 or the group value, depending on the operator used. So, choose wisely!

If you choose to switch NaN Handling 'Off', you can use these operators instead:

- ts_backfill(): Replaces NaNs with the first available non-NaN value.
- is_nan(): If (input == NaN) return 1 else return 0. It can be used with if_else() or trade_when operators to specify the Alpha expression to apply when input = NaN.
- to_nan(): Replaces your NaNs with a value of your choice. Convert value to NaN or NaN to value if reverse=true

thanks for the post, but I am still confused.

for example, suppose I simulate the expression "ts_mean(<data field>, d)"

- when inside window 'd', if all <data field> are nan, what does ts_mean return?
- when inside window 'd', some of <data field> are nan, what does ts_mean return?

can you share some of your thoughts about the above questions? thanks

I encountered the following situation: Before filling nan or backfilling, the alpha signal was very good, but the coverage was quite low. However, after backfilling, the alpha could not be submitted, and the signal even got worse. So should I submit the alpha before backfilling?

NaN, or 'Not a Number,' represents invalid operations or missing data, such as unavailable earnings news between quarters. It's crucial in simulations because NaNs reduce stock coverage, limit trading opportunities, and potentially lower an Alpha’s Sharpe ratio. NaN fluctuations also introduce volatility and higher turnover, as weights for stocks may vary unpredictably.

NaN Handling can be set to "On" to replace NaNs with 0 or group values, increasing coverage but risking ambiguous Alpha data. Alternatively, when set "Off," operators like `ts_backfill()` (fill with first non-NaN value), `is_nan()` (detect NaNs), or `to_nan()` (convert values) help handle NaNs manually, offering more control.

I faced an issue where the alpha signal was strong but had low coverage before filling or backfilling NaNs. However, after backfilling, the signal weakened and couldn’t be submitted. Would it be better to submit the alpha without backfilling in such cases?

**Commonly asked questions:**

**1) Should NaN be OFF or ON?**

This is up to your personal preference. By default, your NaN Handling setting is set to OFF. Some may prefer to have the NaN Handling as OFF so that they can decide how to handle their NaN values in the Alpha expression. If you agree with how the NaN Handling setting handles your NaN values, you can turn it ON.

**2) If backfilling weakens alpha signal, should I submit the alpha without backfilling instead?**

This will depend on the nature of the Alpha you are working on. In general, Alphas with low coverage but strong signal could be depending on very few data points for its performance in the in-sample period and may have a lower likelihood of continuing its performance in the out-sample period. However, some Alpha ideas may be relying on particular event triggers for its performance, then backfilling may not make sense, as it would be prolonging the event trigger on days when the event does not occur.

**Thanks for sharing such an insightful post!**

I have a few thoughts and questions to add:

1. When do you find it best to turn "NaN Handling" **On** versus **Off**? Do you prioritize accuracy over coverage, or vice versa?
2. How do you manage potential data distortion when using `ts_backfill()` for continuous data?
3. Any tips for effectively combining `is_nan()` and `to_nan()` to handle specific scenarios?
4. Have you ever left NaNs untreated and still achieved good Alpha performance, or do you always process them?

Looking forward to learning from everyone’s experiences. Thanks again for the helpful write-up! 😊

NaN is essential to handle properly in simulations to avoid missing opportunities or adding unnecessary volatility. Using NaN Handling options or operators like `ts_backfill()` or `is_nan()` can help manage missing data effectively and improve results.

If you don't want to handle NaN value manually, choose ON, which may introduce ambiguous data into the Alpha, otherwise you can switch to OFF and use the following operaotrs:

- ts_backfill(): Replaces NaNs with the first available non-NaN value.
- is_nan(): If (input == NaN) return 1 else return 0. It can be used with if_else() or trade_when operators to specify the Alpha expression to apply when input = NaN.
- to_nan(): Replaces your NaNs with a value of your choice. Convert value to NaN or NaN to value if reverse=true

to handle it manually.

NaN的處理真的很重要，特別是對於量化交易的新手來說。若是NaN在模擬中頻繁出現，會導致你的股票權重波動，這會直接影響交易機會及夏普比率。你可以選擇將NaN處理設置為ON，這樣會將NaN視為0或使用行業值，但這可能會引入不明數據，但有助於提高總體的覆蓋率。與此同時，若你選擇OFF，則需要利用ts_backfill()等操作手動處理，這樣可以讓你更精確掌控數據的流動性及穩定性。希望你在交易上越來越成熟！

NaN的概念真的是量化交易中的一個大坑！身為一名新手，我經常在模擬中遭遇NaN數據，讓我措手不及。之前讀到，你提到NaN會降低股票的權重，使得我的交易機會大幅下降，這對夏普比率的影響更是嚴重！我了解將NaN處理設置為ON可能會增加覆蓋率，但也會引入一些不準確的數據。相較之下，手動處理雖然繁瑣但能更好控制數據，使用像是ts_backfill()這樣的操作也許是個不錯的選擇。希望未來能更熟練地克服這些挑戰！

NaN, or "Not a Number," represents missing or invalid data, impacting simulations by reducing stock coverage, increasing volatility, and lowering Alpha's Sharpe ratio. Handling NaNs can involve replacing them to boost coverage or using manual methods like ts_backfill(), is_nan(), and to_nan() for precise control and flexibility.

"Thanks for this detailed explanation of NaN and its impact on Alpha generation and simulation performance! The distinction between NaN and an Alpha value of 0 is particularly important for understanding how weights are allocated in simulations.

I appreciate the breakdown of NaN Handling settings and their effects on coverage and volatility. The examples for group and time series operators are very helpful, especially the group_max illustration.

One question I have: In scenarios where data intermittently fluctuates between valid values and NaNs, would you recommend using `ts_backfill()` or `to_nan()` to stabilize the Alpha output? Or is there a case where combining these with `is_nan()` might be more effective?

Looking forward to exploring the linked Learn article for more insights. This post is a great resource for anyone trying to optimize their NaN handling strategies!"
