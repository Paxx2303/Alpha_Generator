## Post Content

In this article, we will cover the following topic: “**Stock Returns Information from the Stock Options Market**”. We recommend reading the book “Finding Alphas” chapter 23 for a more detailed understanding of this content.

**Stock Returns Information from the Stock Options Market**

The equity options market provides a lot of useful information for seeking to predict stock returns. Equity options contribute to price discovery because options traders tend to align their strategies more precisely with the sign and magnitude of their information. Trade information in equity options may provide more refined and precise signals of an underlying asset’s value than a trade in the asset itself.

**Volatility skew**

The implied volatility of stock options is the volatility value of the underlying instrument that, when used as an input in an option pricing model like the Black-Scholes model, produces a theoretical option value that matches the current market price of the option. It is derived from the market prices of options and reflects the market's expectations for future volatility. The volatility skew is the difference in implied volatility between high and low strike price. Reverse skews occur when the implied volatility is higher on lower options strikes, and forward skews occur in the opposite situation. To create Alphas based on this concept, note the fact that researchers have shown that there is a negative association between volatility skews and individual stock returns at the company level.

The BRAIN platform provides a large range of [option analytics data](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option9) and [volatility data](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option8) . In volatility data, not only historical volatility data but also implied volatility and volatility skew data are provided, so feel free to use these data to develop your own Alphas.

Here is an Alpha example:

**Volatility Spread**

According to put-call parity, for European options (which can be exercised only at expiration), the following equality holds:

*Call prices–Put prices = Spot price–Discount factor*Strike price*

For American options (which can be exercised at any time prior to expiration), this equation takes the form of:

*Spot price >= Call prices–Put prices+Discount factor*Strike price*

From these relations, we can discover that for European options call and put options have the same implied volatility, and for American options call and put option have a “volatility spread” which derives from early-exercise premium. This spread can be used in various ways. For example, you may form this into sentiment score, since volatility spread represents the potential impact of the expected news, by measuring the overall net buying pressure. (When volatility gets bigger the demand of a call option is getting bigger than the corresponding put option.)

For BRAIN consultants, the BRAIN platform offers much larger range of additional datasets than user level datasets. Volatility spread data (***mdl777_2400_rmi***) is also in consultant dataset named model77.

**Options trading volume**

The option to stock volume ratio (O/S ratio) provides the theoretical and practical evidence that represents the private information that an information-based trader can use. This research states that information-based traders prefer options trading when they expect bad news due to capital restrictions and short costs.

Options trading volume is also included in consultant dataset, which are ***opt6_cvolu*** (call option) and ***opt6_pvolu*** (put option) in Forecasted Volatility for Equity Options (option6) dataset.

**Option open interest**

Open interest is the number of outstanding options contracts on a given underlying asset. Researchers found that options traders are buying more (fewer) call options (put options) when underlying assets is the near-term are bullish. In their practical research, they showed there is strong negative relation between put option open interest and expected underlying asset returns.

An Alpha using [Put-Call Open Interest ratio](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/create-alphas/19-alpha-examples#put-call-open-interest-ratio-pcr-oi) is presented on the [Alpha Examples for Beginners](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/create-alphas/19-alpha-examples) , so you can use it to develop your own Alpha. If you want to use more specific data, try browsing the consultant dataset Implied Volatility and Pricing for Equity Options (option4). This dataset includes option open interest as ***opt4_call_openinterest*** (call option) and ***opt4_put_openinterest*** (put option).

Additionally, you can find a lot of information to help you if you [search for “option” in the BRAIN community](/hc/en-us/search?query=option&utf8=%E2%9C%93) . If you're interested in developing Alphas using options trading information, please take a look!

Hi, I noticed that there are some difficult to use data option sets such as option7, option 24, option 22, option38. Will there be articles explaining how to use these option sets. Hope Brain considers

I find that data options seem to have a very good ability to predict the future, because they have future expire orders, which in turn affect the stock price.

The article provides an insightful overview of leveraging equity options data to predict stock returns. It highlights key concepts like volatility skew, volatility spread, trading volume, and open interest. Detailed examples and BRAIN platform resources are well-explained. However, additional clarity on practical Alpha development workflows using these datasets would enhance understanding.

Thank you for sharing this insightful article! The detailed explanation of how stock returns information from the stock options market can be used to predict stock returns is very helpful. I particularly appreciate the breakdown of volatility skew, volatility spread, and the significance of options trading volume and open interest. The additional datasets available on the BRAIN platform will certainly be valuable for developing and testing new Alphas. I’m excited to explore these concepts further and apply them to my strategies.

The article offers a detailed overview of using equity options data to forecast stock returns, covering concepts like volatility skew, volatility spread, trading volume, and open interest. While it provides clear examples and insights into BRAIN platform resources, more details on practical Alpha development workflows would be beneficial.

In "Finding Alphas" Chapter 23, the article discusses how stock returns can be influenced by data from the stock options market. The equity options market offers valuable insights that can enhance stock return predictions, as options traders typically have more precise information on the underlying asset.

Thank you for sharing such a detailed overview of how equity options data can be leveraged to predict stock returns! As a new trader navigating these concepts, I find the discussion on volatility skew and open interest particularly enlightening. I’m eager to dive deeper into how these insights can be transformed into actionable Alphas. The BRAIN platform seems to offer a treasure trove of data, and I can't wait to explore the available datasets. Anyone else here finding these strategies useful in their trading journey? Let’s exchange tips and insights as we learn together!
