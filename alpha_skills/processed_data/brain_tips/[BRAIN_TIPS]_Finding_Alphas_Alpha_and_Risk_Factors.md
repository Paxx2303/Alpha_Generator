In this article, we will cover the following topic: **Alpha and risk factors**. We recommend reading the book “Finding Alphas” chapter 13 for a more detailed understanding of this content.

**Alpha and Risk Factors**

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) states that stock’s expected return can be represented by linear formula involving the market risk premium (MRP = Market return–Risk free rate) and stock’s market beta.

*Expected return = Risk-free rate + Stock market beta * Market risk premium*

Expanding on this concept, the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) suggests that a stock’s expected return is determined by a linear function of its sensitivities to multiple unspecified factors:

*Expected return = Risk-free rate + sum(Stock’s factor beta * Factor’s risk premium)*

Under these assumptions, researchers around the world have identified several risk factors that contribute to the formation of outperforming portfolios. Some examples of these risk factors are as follows:

- Market risk
- BE/ME ratio
- E/P ratio
- Size effect (small stocks have higher expected return)
- Profitability (stocks with robust operating profitability outperform)
- Investment (reinvestment of company earnings implies higher return)
- Momentum effect (winners outperform losers)
- Accrual anomaly (Stocks with high accrual profitability underperform)
- Liquidity effect (less liquid stocks have higher expected return)
- …

However, it is challenging to identify whether those risks are the result of irrational individual investment, or the rational compensation for systematic risks. Practically, it is more important to understand if those risks will persist in the future. Andrew Lo’s Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH) provides valuable insights in regard, suggesting that the market isn’t in equilibrium but evolves like an ecosystem, thus market risk and reward may not remain as stable as they have been and could wax or wane over time. So, in the process of researching Alphas, we should consider those issues:

- Sharpe ratio may not remain high when the Alpha is based on a well-known idea. Smart money gets the profit until it becomes less attractive.
- Some risk factors such as size or liquidity have an imbalance between long and short sides of factor expression, which can lead to difficulty in liquidating both positions equivalently, especially in a market crisis phase.
- Well-studied risk factors are popularly implemented by many quantitative investment firms. If huge players liquidate their position, it can exacerbate other players’ losses.

Another thing to keep in mind when dealing with risk factors is that one risk factor may have exposure to another risk. For example, if you set the sentiment volume (scl12_buzz) for an individual company as a risk factor, as the amount of news increases, the transaction volume also increases, so you may also be exposed to the risk of transaction volume. A typical way to neutralize (reduce) this exposure is the vector_neut(v1,v2) operator, which subtracts the vector that projects the v1 vector onto the v2 vector from v1, leaving only the components orthogonal to v2. (Refer to the picture below.)

In addition, in BRAIN you can neutralize factors through [Neutralization setting](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/neut-cons) . There are only neutralization options of Market, Sector, Industry, and Subindustry at the user level, but consultants have access to additional neutralization options for various factors such as Slow Factor and Fast Factor.

Since the sentiment volume data field (scl12_buzz) is a scalar field, how would you aggregate multiple fields into a vector that can be fed into the vector_neut(v1,v2) operator to implement the neutralization (risk reduction) idea above?

We neutralize a vector of positions against the other.

If you are neutralizing snt_buzz against volume, where both are matrix operators in US 3000, the vector of 3000 X 1 will be formed for snt_buzz, which will be neutralized against a 3000 X 1 volume vector.

Alpha and risk factors are key in portfolio strategies. CAPM and APT outline expected returns using market and multi-factor risk premiums. Consider persistence of risk factors, exposure imbalances, and liquidation risks. Utilize tools like BRAIN’s Neutralization settings and vector_neut operators to mitigate risks and refine Alpha strategies for optimal performance.

To build on these insights, I think it's also crucial to continuously evaluate the stability of these risk factors over different market cycles. Long-term performance can be improved by diversifying across less correlated factors, and regularly rebalancing models to adapt to changing market conditions. Moreover, using multiple neutralization techniques for various risk factors (e.g., market, sector, sentiment) could help to mitigate risks and improve the robustness of Alpha models in the long term.

In "Finding Alphas" Chapter 13, the article explores Alpha and risk factors, emphasizing their importance in portfolio construction and performance. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) provide frameworks for understanding the expected return of a stock, with APT incorporating multiple risk factors. Key risk factors identified include market risk, BE/ME ratio, E/P ratio, size effect, profitability, momentum, and liquidity.
