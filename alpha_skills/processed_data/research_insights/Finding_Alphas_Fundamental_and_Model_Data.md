In the book “Finding Alphas”, Chapter 19 “Financial Statement Analysis” **[1]** and Chapter 20 “Fundamental Analysis and Alpha Research” **[2]** introduce the data available in financial statements and discusses the ways to perform financial statement analysis.

**Financial statement data**

Financial statements consist of the four main statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, statement of shareholders’ equity) and the notes to these financial statements, which represent a summary of a company’s financial health. The former is found in the in the  [***Company Fundamental Data for Equity***](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/fundamental6)  dataset, while the latter is in the  [***Report Footnotes***](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/fundamental2)  dataset.

1. **Balance Sheet:** The balance sheet offers a financial snapshot of an entity at a particular point in time. It is represented by the balance sheet equation: Asset = Liabilities + Equity. Both ***assets*** and ***equity*** are data fields available on BRAIN, while liabilities can usually be represented by ***debt***. On the top of that, you can also derive liabilities by taking ***assets - equity***.
2. **Income Statement:** The income statement reflects changes in the balance sheet from one period to the next. It can be represented by Revenue–Expenses = Net Income. Both ***revenue*** and ***net income*** are data fields available on BRAIN, while you can derive the expenses by taking ***revenue - net income***.
3. **Cash Flow Statement:**The cash flow statement describes the sources of the change in a company’s cash balance from one period to the next. For example, ***cashflow = cash – ts_delay(cash, 252)***, which means that cash flow movement for the year is equal to the cash balance at the end of the current year less the cash balance at the end of the earlier year.
4. **Statement of Shareholders’ Equity:** The statement of shareholders’ equity shows the change in the equity section of the balance sheet during the given period. Shareholders’ equity (***equity***) includes common equity (***fnd6_ceq***) and retained earnings (***retained_earnings***).

Financial statement analysis

There are financial measures available in the Company Fundamental Data for Equity dataset and the Model Data dataset that can be considered when constructing fundamental Alphas.

1. **Profitability:** gross margin (***mdf_grm***)
2. **Liquidity:** current ratio (***mdf_ccr***)
3. **Solvency:** debt / equity ratio (***mdf_deq***)
4. **Cash flow:** cash flow from operations (***mdf_coa***)
5. **Growth:** net income / total assets (***income / assets***)
6. **Valuation:** price/book ratio (***mdf_pbk***),

Rather than just accepting the data in the financial statements, you also need the ability to understand and interpret them in depth. For example, profit consists of two parts: the actual cash flow generated from operations (***mdf_coa***) and the accrual amount calculated by the management/accountants (***mdf_rev-mdf_coa***). Since the accrual amount is subject to some variance, the actual cash flow of the company can be a better indicator of the company’s performance. In fact, a study by Sloan et al. (2011) found that cash-based profits are a stronger predictor of future corporate performance than accrual-based profits including accruals. When judging a company’s quality and profitability, it is important to analyze accounting events.

In addition, analyzing fundamental data can offer ideas for alternative stock classifications when doing Alpha research. Depending on financial performance, companies can be classified as value stocks or growth stocks, and companies can also be classified according to their leverage ratio. These various classification criteria allow you to further refine your position by classifying companies, neutralizing them according to each classification, and so on.

Hi, I noticed that the os of alphas using fundamental data mostly have very good performance, so why is it limited to 30%. Besides the correlation is also very low

Most alpha models and fundamentals usually have low turnover, making it easy to build alpha. In my opinion, you should look back for a few months or more to better capture signals.

Thank you for the detailed summary of financial statement analysis and its application in Alpha research. The breakdown of the key financial statements—balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and shareholders' equity—provides a clear understanding of available data fields and their relevance. The inclusion of fundamental financial measures, such as profitability (gross margin) and valuation (price/book ratio), is especially helpful for constructing robust Alphas. The insight about cash-based profits being stronger predictors of performance than accrual-based profits is particularly valuable. Additionally, the suggestion to classify stocks by financial metrics for refined positioning adds great depth to Alpha research. Much appreciated!

This is a great overview of financial statement analysis and its relevance for Alpha research! The breakdown of key financial metrics and their interpretations is particularly insightful. I’m curious about how you might combine profitability and growth measures to create a more robust Alpha strategy. Would love to hear your thoughts!

In order to make alphas on model data,start with machine learning dataset using fields like mdl110_score,mdl110_value,mdl_analyst_sentiment

Thank you for the detailed explanation of financial statement analysis! The breakdown of key financial metrics like profitability, liquidity, and cash flow is very useful for constructing fundamental Alphas. I particularly appreciate the emphasis on distinguishing cash-based profits from accruals, as this can provide a more accurate measure of a company’s performance. The idea of using financial data for stock classification and refining alpha strategies is also insightful.

Hi TK95999! Could you share more about where your "os of alphas using fundamental data" is from, and what the "limited to 30%" is referring to?

---

### Comment by LK29993 1 year ago
Hi HV77283! There are many ways to combine profitability and growth ideas in your Alpha. One way is to find indicators that capture both aspects, e.g. the growth in profitability over the past 3 years.

Understanding and interpreting financial statements is crucial for constructing meaningful fundamental alphas. This analysis involves not just looking at raw data but understanding how to interpret it, especially considering the nuances of accruals versus cash flow.
