My IS performance positive but os will be negative then o/s ratio became negative what i do that it will became positive and last 2 years pnl also become positive

There are many cases where all the years is sharpe are positive but os is negative, most likely due to overfitting of alpha. You should check both sub - uni sharpe, rank and sign test to check the robustness of the signal.

You should check train - test on many intervals (cross sectional test) such as 1, 2 or half year test, then calculate mean test / mean train sharpe, if above 0.7 then alpha will be robust

I think Overfitting is the main reason for strong IS performance but poor OS results.

Hi, you should try to minimize the data and operators on your alpha as much as possible, to check which signal has the best performance, then optimize, it will reduce the possibility of alpha overfitting

Start with simpler models and gradually add complexity only when necessary to reduce overfitting when building alphas. Use cross-validation to ensure your model generalizes well, and apply regularization to prevent overfitting. Focus on feature selection by reducing irrelevant features using methods like PCA or correlation analysis.

Please use the OS backtests that the video tutorial in Brain mentioned, such as rank or binary test to ensure the robustness of the alpha.

If your IS (in-sample) performance is positive but OS (out-of-sample) performance is negative, the issue is likely overfitting or lack of robustness in your alpha design.

**Sub-unit Sharpe ratios** break down the performance of the alpha into smaller time periods or subsets (e.g., annual, quarterly, or monthly). This allows you to examine whether the alpha consistently performs well across different time periods or whether the positive performance is just due to a specific time window or market condition.

Begin with simple models and add complexity cautiously to minimize overfitting. Use cross-validation for generalization, apply regularization, and enhance feature selection by reducing irrelevant features through methods like PCA or correlation analysis.

- Identify why the operating costs (expenses) are higher than your revenue. Is it due to higher raw material costs, inefficient processes, or fixed costs that are difficult to control?
- Look into your cost structure. Are there areas where you can reduce expenses without affecting the quality of your products or services?

It sounds like you're concerned about a situation where your IS (Income Statement) performance is positive, but the OS (Operating Statement) is negative, causing the O/S ratio to become negative. You also want to ensure that the last two years of P&L (Profit and Loss) turn positive.

Your alpha might be overfitting. A key indicator is positive performance during the IS period but negative performance in the OS period, often evident by a steadily declining PnL chart. The cause could be that your alpha is overly complex, combining multiple small signals to force the PnL to rise during the IS period.

Combining alphas from different datasets or categories can help reduce correlation and improve robustness. However, it's crucial to ensure that the combined alphas are not overly correlated, as this can lead to performance degradation in the OS period. Consider the following:

- **Cross-category combinations**: Mix alphas from different data categories (e.g., macroeconomic data with technical indicators) to enhance diversification.
- **Synergistic alphas**: Focus on combining alphas that complement each other rather than just reducing correlation.

Make sure the dataset you're using is appropriate for the multiplier. Different regions and themes may require different datasets for accurate predictions. Sometimes using a dataset that doesn't align with the theme or multiplier can lead to discrepancies in the checks.

**Increase Operating Profit (IS)**: Since the IS performance is positive, try to further optimize operational efficiencies. You can look for cost-saving opportunities, improve sales margins, and streamline your business processes to boost operating profit.

In many cases, despite all in-sample years showing a positive Sharpe ratio, the out-of-sample performance turns negative, likely due to alpha overfitting. To ensure signal robustness, evaluate sub-universe Sharpe, rank consistency, and sign tests.

Hi  [MS18311](/hc/en-us/profiles/4602797735575-MS18311) !

A negative OS/IS ratio usually indicates that you may be overfitting your alpha to the IS period. Here are some tips to avoid overfitting:  [https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8209806533015-How-can-you-avoid-overfitting](https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/8209806533015-How-can-you-avoid-overfitting)

## Steps to Achieve a Positive O/S Ratio and Positive P&L

## 1. Increase Revenue

- **Enhance Sales**: Focus on strategies to boost sales and revenue. This could involve improving product offerings, enhancing customer service, or expanding into new markets.
- **Optimize Pricing**: Review pricing strategies to ensure they are competitive yet profitable.

## 2. Reduce Operating Expenses

- **Cost Efficiency**: Implement cost-saving measures such as streamlining operations, reducing waste, and renegotiating contracts with suppliers.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Improve processes to reduce overhead costs.

## 3. Manage Assets and Liabilities

- **Asset Utilization**: Ensure that assets are being used efficiently. Consider divesting underutilized assets to reduce maintenance costs.
- **Debt Management**: Focus on reducing debt to minimize interest payments and improve financial health.

## 4. Long-Term Financial Planning

- **Budgeting**: Create comprehensive budgets that account for future expenses and revenue projections.
- **Capital Expenditure Planning**: Plan capital expenditures carefully to ensure they align with available funds and future needs.

## 5. Review and Adjust

- **Regular Financial Reviews**: Conduct regular financial reviews to identify areas for improvement.
- **Adapt Strategies**: Be prepared to adjust strategies based on financial performance and market conditions.

Using cross-validation and applying regularization to prevent it from clinging to noise. Feature selection is just as important—dropping irrelevant features through PCA or correlation analysis can help keep your signals clean and effective. The key is to strike a balance between complexity and robustness.

Merging alphas from various datasets can enhance robustness and reduce correlation. Ensure they’re not overly correlated to avoid OS performance issues. Combine complementary alphas for better diversification.
